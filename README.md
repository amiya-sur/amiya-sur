## My Protfolio Projects
My Repository contains data science/ data analysis projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, or R markdown files.  

### Content. 
- [Walmart Retail Analysis and Sales Prediction](https://github.com/amiya-sur/Walmart-Sales-Analysis-with-LinearRegression) - *This Graded Porject is part of the Simplilearn Masters Program on Data Science and Business Analytics where I was presented with Walmart Retail stores historical data for exploratory data analysis popularly known as EDA and finally build a predictive model to forecast demands for a particular store in absence of historical data or such unexpected scenarios.*
  
- [Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis using R](https://github.com/amiya-sur/Cylicstic-Bike-Share-Analysis-using-R) - *This is graded project under Google Data Analytics - Capstone Project: Complete a Case Study to earn the Google Certified Data Analyst Professional Certificate. The primary focus of this project is to find:*
  * *Question 1 - How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?*

  *The above analysis has finally helped me find patterns and key insights from the 12 months historical data. This insights may help the company in taking data-driven decisions     for turning maximum Casual riders to Annual members and increase the revenue of the organisation.*
  
- [Water Potability Prediction using Machine Learning Approach](https://github.com/amiya-sur/Detecting-Water-Potaility-using-Data-Analytics.git) - *An in-depth exploration and analysis of a dataset detailing water quality parameters, aiming to classify water as potable or non-potable. Through comprehensive data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning, this project successfully predicts water safety for consumption. The Random Forest model emerged as the top performer, offering insights that can significantly impact public health and safety decisions regarding water quality.*

-[Image Caption Generation on COCO_5070 Dataset](https://github.com/amiya-sur/image-caption-generation-COCO_5070-dataset.git) - This project embarks on the challenging domain of computer vision and natural language processing, endeavoring to automatically generate descriptive captions for images. Utilizing the COCO_5070 dataset, the project employs a two-tier architecture: an encoder based on a pre-trained ResNet-50 model and a custom-designed RNN decoder. The performance of the captioning model is meticulously evaluated using BLEU scores and cosine similarity, offering a holistic view of its efficacy. The insights derived from this project can serve as a foundation for enhancing visual content accessibility on digital platforms and further research in the domain of multi-modal machine learning.

-[Advanced Groundwater Level Forecasting in Memphis Aquifer](https://github.com/amiya-sur/MSc_Project2023_final_submission.git) - A scientific exploration into Groundwater Level (GWL) forecasting in West Tennessee USA. The study delves deep into the intricacies of groundwater dynamics using a combination of time series analysis and machine learning techniques. By introducing a pioneering hybrid ARIMA-LSTM model, the study not only achieves superior forecasting accuracy but also uncovers the subtle interplay between environmental factors and groundwater levels. This comprehensive analysis serves as a crucial step towards sustainable water management in the region, supported by data-driven insights and innovative modeling approaches
